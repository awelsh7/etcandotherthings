			<p>I can think of no better game to review first than Bezzerwizzer, &quot;the game of trivia, tactics, and trickery&quot;.I was first introduced to this game 5-6 years ago because a friend of mine owned it and after the first play I immediately had to buy a copy for myself. At the time the only trivia game I owned was a version of Trivial Pursuit from the &#39;60s where the questions were so out of date it practically unplayable (not that I didn&#39;t still try). And there is the first thing I love about Bezzerwizzer: the questions. Like most trivia games they include a wide range of subjects and difficulty levels, but ultimately I find that they&#39;re all answerable to a person of the modern era, given the proper knowledge base. Of course, there will always be those questions that leave you asking, &quot;Who would ever know <em>that?&quot;</em></p>
			<p>The actual rules are fun and easy. You reach into a bag filled with 20 tiles, each representing a different category from Architecture to Religion to Television. You then place the tiles on the board in order of how well you think you know that category. If you get the question in the first position (category you know the least) correct, you move your token one space, if you get the question in the second position correct, move 2 spaces, etc. You win when you reach the end of the board. Simple, right?</p>
			<p>That&#39;s when the Bezzerwizzer and Zwap tiles come in! (Because it&#39;s just not a good board game if you don&#39;t, at some point, yell nonesense words.) Each player is given 2 Bezzerwizzers and 1 Zwap every round. Bezzerwizzer tiles allow you to try and answer someone else&#39;s question if they get it wrong and Zwaps give the power to SWAP (see what they did there?) one of your category tiles with someone else&#39;s.This adds a level of strategy to the game as you can put a category you don&#39;t like in a high position if you plan to Zwap it later.</p>
			<p>It takes only one round of play to get a handle of therule, ranking this game very low on complexity. For anyone who enjoys trivia-based games I would highly reccommend Bezzerwizzer as a basic and striaghtforward staple to any game night. As far as player, the box says 2+ but there are only enough tokens for 4. However, there are 20 categories, enough for 5 players if you&#39;re willing to use a makeshift token from around the house or another game to move across the board. More people can play if you play on teams, which can also be fun.</p>

As you can see my question box has been taped together and my tiles are fading; proof of how often I turn to this game for a fun night with friends.
